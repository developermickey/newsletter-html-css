                <h2><span class="mark">CEO’s Desk</span> - A Budget Poised for Growth</h2>
                <p>The Union Budget 2025 presents a bold vision for India’s financial sector, emphasizing credit
                    accessibility, regulatory efficiency, and investment inflows. Key measures such as the Grameen
                    Credit Score Framework and the revamped CKYC registry aim to simplify credit assessments and boost
                    financial inclusion. Meanwhile, NaBFID’s partial credit enhancement facility is set to strengthen
                    corporate bonds and infrastructure financing, while higher FDI in insurance is expected to drive
                    capital expansion. MSMEs and rural borrowers stand to benefit significantly, with expanded credit
                    support through initiatives like the PM Swanidhi revamp and customized credit cards for
                    micro-enterprises.</p>
                <p>These reforms directly complement the growing Account Aggregator (AA) ecosystem, which facilitates
                    seamless, consent-driven financial data sharing. With DPI-Bharat Tradenet simplifying trade
                    financing and Kisan Credit Card limits increasing, AA can play a pivotal role in enhancing digital
                    lending efficiency and scaling credit access across sectors. The move to raise the income tax rebate
                    limit to ₹12 lakh will further boost disposable income, increasing both savings and demand for
                    financial services, reinforcing the need for better digital financial infrastructure.</p>
                <p>India is moving toward a more resilient, tech-driven financial landscape, balancing inclusion with
                    investment-led expansion. As these reforms take shape, Sahamati remains committed to strengthening
                    the AA framework—ensuring it serves as a critical enabler in unlocking credit access, improving
                    financial products, and supporting India's economic growth.</p>

                    <h2><span class="mark">The AA</span> Impact Story:</h2>
                    <p>A leading Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) recently shared how Account Aggregator (AA)
                        integration significantly enhanced user engagement and financial services adoption. Beyond
                        credit facilitation, the RIA has transitioned from SMS-based spend analysis—which relied on
                        scraping transactional messages, raising security and privacy concerns—to AA-powered financial
                        tools. Unlike SMS scraping, which lacks user control and exposes sensitive data, AA ensures
                        secure, consent-based data sharing. With real-time spending insights, budgeting, and
                        personalized financial planning, this shift has empowered consumers with a clearer, more
                        structured view of their personal financial health.

                    <p>The RBI’s first repo rate cut in 5 years—25 bps down to 6.25%—is a strong tailwind for India’s
                        credit ecosystem. Easier borrowing will accelerate MSME lending, fuel investments, and spur
                        consumption, especially as income tax cuts are also on the horizon.</p>
                    <p>Indian banks are increasingly leveraging AI for regulatory capital planning, liquidity
                        management, and personalized services. However, concerns remain over AI’s “black box” nature,
                        prompting the RBI to introduce oversight mechanisms, including a regulatory sandbox and the
                        Framework for Responsible and Ethical Enablement of AI (FREE-AI). This aims to balance
                        innovation with accountability in financial services.
